# Deep RL Quadcopter Controller

_Teach a Quadcopter How to Fly!_

In this project, you will design an agent to fly a quadcopter, and then train it using a reinforcement learning algorithm of your choice!

## Project Instructions

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the downloaded folder.

```
git clone https://github.com/marcionicolau/personal_mle.git
cd personal_mle/quadcop-rl
```

2. Create and activate a new environment.

```
conda env create -f quadcop-rl.yaml
source activate quadcop
```

3. Open the notebook.

```
jupyter notebook Quadcopter_Project.ipynb
```

4. Before running code, change the kernel to match the `quadcop` environment by using the drop-down menu (**Kernel > Change kernel > quadcop**). Then, follow the instructions in the notebook.
